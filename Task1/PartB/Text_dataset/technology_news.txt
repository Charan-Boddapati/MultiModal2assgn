Content: Emphasis on odds. Feed refreshed 3 minutes ago XO MWC Former Gizmodo EIC Dan Ackermans lawsuit alleging that Apple, the Tetris company, screenwriter Noah Pink and others ripped off his 2016 book, The Tetris Effect The Game That Hypnotized the World, for their 2023 Apple TV Plus movie has been dismissed. Reuters reports Ackermans lawyer said he will appeal the decision. In her ruling, Judge Katherine Failla writes Ultimately, the Court finds that Defendants Film is not substantially similar to Plaintiffs Book and that Plaintiff has failed to allege that Defendants misappropriated the way he selected, coordinated, and arranged the facts in his Book. Where the Books tone is informative, the Films is suspenseful and dramatic, at times deviating from the true facts underlying the story and going so far as to invent an entire KGB subplot, which takes up significant screen time, to create that theatrical effect. The mute keys label now features a speaker with a strike through it so it more closely resembles the icon that appears in macOS when pressed, as spotted by iCulture. Apple made the change on the new iPad Airs Magic Keyboard, too. Lena Raine, the composer of Celestes amazing soundtrack, shared some songs from the Celeste teams cancelled game Earthblade on Bandcamp. Because well never get a chance to tell that story in game form, I decided to cobble together every bit of music Id written for the game to the point of its cancellation in order to tell my own version of it, Raine says. By the way, Bandcamp Fridays are back for 2025.

The carrier plans to upgrade approximately 40 planes each month starting in May, with the goal of equipping the entire fleet of twocabin regional aircraft by the end of the year. His distorted face has been inescapable on social media  blown up and tinted like a blueberry, smooth and textureless, edited as a Minion and Furby. What began as an easy own has spiraled into a fullblown meme of making the vice president look like a child with a propeller hat and candy. Vance, apparently, is definitely not mad and is laughing, actually. A day after workers at the US African Development Foundation blocked Elon Musks cronies from entering their office, DOGE employees came back with federal marshals, The New York Times reports. The DOGE team had been described as very young men with backpacks. This Times photo shows the DOGE employees entering on Thursday with their escort. We gave a brief overview of the components that make up the prototype AR glasses in our Orion handson, but Meta just released a series of blogs that go deep. I mean real deep into why they picked silicon carbide, as well as the tech in its custom silicon chips and compute pucks. Theres also some neat photos, especially in the blog on the silicon chips, that give you a good sense of all the tech in those glasses. Googles new affordable phone has leaked repeatedly already, but its back again in new images shared by Evan Blass on X. Theyre mostly marketing images and renders of the purple model  supposedly dubbed Iris  and closely match the design weve seen before, complete with an almost perfectly flat camera bump.

The bike is only for show right now, but may be moving by this summer at a leisurely 6 mph. The unexploded bomb was discovered overnight in the SaintDenis suburb of Paris during works on the tracks, halting the Eurostar and all other local trains at Gare du Nord, Frances busiest station. Impacted Eurostar travellers are being asked to move their journey to a different date.

The New York Times reports Trump signed an EO Thursday evening to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile consisting of crypto assets owned by the Treasury forfeited in criminal or civil cases. In a video, the president prepared to sign as a voice offscreen called it like a digital Fort Knox for digital gold, however CoinDesk notes that not everyone in crypto feels like they got what they paid for yet, with one exec calling it the most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week. whitehouse.gov As part of the DOGEdirected reshaping of the federal government, General Services Administration listed more than 400 federal properties designated for disposal earlier this week, before replacing them with a coming soon message.

However, some gamers have been complaining for weeks of thumbstick issues, and Ive also noticed some odd behavior. The controller customizers at Battle Beaver Customs said the update added a limitation to the max range of thumbstick values and a virtual dead zone, but Microsoft hasnt confirmed whether thats the issue its fixing. support.xbox.com Waymo has been testing the new vehicle for months now, but always with camouflage. Now it seems like the wrapping is coming off, thanks to this video captured by YouTube channel I Love Vehicles. As some Reddit users noted, the rear lidar in particular could prove tempting to folks looking to do some chinups. Me?

Volkswagen previewed its ultralow cost 20,000 ID EVERY1 electric vehicle yesterday, but the press material didnt mention that its the first EV to launch with technology developed by Rivian, thanks to their 5.8 billion joint venture. Thankfully, TechCrunch got the inside info. Notably, VWs 25,000 ID.2all, coming in 2026, will be built on E3 1.1 stack developed by VWs software unit Cariad. I find it very interesting that VW is tasking Rivian to develop a central nervous system for its cheapest model first. techcrunch.com In Government Cheese, Apples new comedy cocreated by Paul Hunter and Aeysha Carr, an unusual family living in late 60s San Francisco find their lives turned upside down when the head of the house David Oyelowo is freed from a stint in prison.
